## NOTE

Some code is added only for demonstrating purposes, and might not be suitable for a real-world application.

## Starting Development

Start the app in the `dev` environment:

```bash
npm start
```

## Instructions
**It is tested on MacOS using the NodeJS version mentioned below. There is no guarantee it will start/work as expected on other OS**
The development server can be ran locally using NPM. This allows testing of the application's code locally. 

Required dependencies on the host PC are: [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/), [ReactJs](https://reactjs.org/), [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

## Building and Running the Local Development Servers
1. Ensure that Node.js is installed on the host PC - Supported version is 16.14.x but others might also work
2. Run the following command from the terminal in order to install the necessary dependencies:
```
npm install
```
3. Wait a few seconds
4. To start the development server, run the following command:
```
npm start
```
5. Wait for the server to start
6. You should now be able to see the app running (at localhost:3000)

7. Congrats, You've made it! :)
